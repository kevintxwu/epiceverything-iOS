EpicEverything
==============
Epic Everything is a Trading Card Game for anyone, anywhere! A mobile-first TCG for the casual audience. With Epic Everything, we make every joke, every simplification, and every effort to keep the experience enjoyable on-the-go on small screens and with whoever, from all ages.

Epic Everything values simplicity, keeping the depth of the effects of cards like weapons, enchantments, spells, but translating them into very diverse versions of a single type: creatures. 

To counteract a possible loss of variety, we add one simple, but very interesting mechanic: positioning. Creatures can only attack the cards around them, except for certain ranged creatures, that can attack the whole board, and attacking an open space is a direct attack! It's something completely new and sure to shake things up.

We've also focused on building a mix between modern, flat design and beautiful, traditional art, for the best-looking game we can make.
